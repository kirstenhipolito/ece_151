**ECE 151 Project 1**

Project 1 is an implementation of TCP over UDP.
  
  To test:
  1. Have a savetothisfile.txt and sendthisfile.txt ready.
  2. Run server on one terminal:
    ./server (port number) (filename of savetothisfile.txt) (proto)
  3. Run client on another terminal:
    ./client (IP address e.g. 127.0.0.1 for same machine) (port number) (filename of sendthisfile.txt) (proto)
    

**ECE 151 Project 2**

Project 2 is a traffic tracker. It monitors the TCP connections and data your computer exchanges for a certain period of time that the user can set, and outputs info on your traffic afterwards. In particular it outputs the IP addresses you interacted with, the total bytes and packets exchanged with each, the domain names, the countries and the lat/long coordinates. Their locations are also plotted on a global map.
